Rationale
=========

Matchbox is not as much about actually matching data as about preprocessing it in such way, that the actual matching is a simple and one retrieve.

Now, please note that matchbox makes these assumptions about data:

* Data (objects) are being described by attributes - called here characteristics
* Objects might be described by all possible values
* Objects can't be described by none.
* There's no point for object to be described by some specific values, but not by other set of specific values.

Now we'll try to explain what each of these point means.
