        Initialise box and set attribute this box will be indexing objects on.

        Indexed objects are expected to have attribute of the same name as
        `characteristic` that contains value by which object is classified.
        Optionally objects should have second attribute that will state that
        the object is classified by the value **OR** that he object is not
        classified by the value called **{characteristic}_match**.

        ... note::

            Whole matchbox'es idea follows the idea that while you can't say
            that given object is not described by anything.
            You can say that object's characteristic is, or is not described by
            a subset of all values possible, you can't say the object is not
            described by all of them. The third possibility is that it's
            described by all of them - otherwise the logic dictates that the
            object will not ever match, hence it shouldn't even make it to the
            collection.
